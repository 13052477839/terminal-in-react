# Contributing Guide

I'm excited to have you helping out. Thank you so much for your time.

## Contributing

### Setting up the environment

Considering you've forked and cloned the repo on your system, switch to the directory and install the dependencies.

```
cd terminal-in-react
npm install
```

### Changes or adding features

All the components and stylesheets can be found in [components](./components) directory. 

After you're done making changes to the codebase, generate the bundle.

```
npm run build:production
```

This will generate a file `terminal.js` in the `build` directory.

That's it!! I'm excited to see your pull request.
