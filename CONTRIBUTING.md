# Contributing Guide

I'm excited to have you helping out. Thank you so much for your time.

## Contributing

### Setting up the environment

Considering you've forked and cloned the repo on your system, switch to the directory and install the dependencies.

```
cd terminal-in-react
npm install
```

### Submitting pull requests

*   Create a new branch for the new feature: `git checkout -b new-feature`
*   Make your changes.
*   `npm run build:production` for bundling everything.
*   Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
*   Push to the branch: `git push origin new-feature`
*   Submit a pull request with full remarks documenting your changes.

### Starting development server

To test your changes, there is a [starter](./starter) folder where you will find two files, `index.html` and `App.js`. 

Make changes to `App.js` and start the development server with -

```
npm run start
```

That's it! I am excited to see your pull request.
