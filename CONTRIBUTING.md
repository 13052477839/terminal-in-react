# Contributing Guide

I'm excited to have you helping out. Thank you so much for your time.

## Contributing

### Setting up the environment

Considering you've forked and cloned the repo on your system, switch to the directory and install the dependencies.

```
cd terminal-in-react
npm install
```

### Making Changes or adding features

All the components and stylesheets can be found in [components](./components) directory. 

After you've made changes to the codebase, generate the bundle.

```
npm run build:production
```

This will generate a file `terminal.js` in the `build` directory.

### Starting development server

To test your changes, there is a [starter](./starter) folder where you will find two files, `index.html` and `App.js`. 

Start the development server with -

```
npm run start
```

That's it! I am excited to see your pull request.
